# Overview
 
The user can input a year and then it shows the day of the month in each month.


The purpose of the program is to show each month in the year. The user can put any year from 1573.

# Development Environment

I used Rider, and the IDE that is installed on the program.
I also used Github to store everything. 

I only used Koltin to create this program

# Future Work

- I was originally going to allow the user to add tasks, but the display of the year took all of my time. As well as the logic to get it.
- I want to be able to fix the bug in my program. I am not sure why it isn't aligning. 
- I want them to be able to choose a month and see a close up version.
